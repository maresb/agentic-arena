  "rationale": "All agents correctly identified Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the SOTA choice. Agent A provided the most intelligent preparation strategy by leveraging the user's GNOME window metadata to perform semantic cropping rather than naive grid tiling (Agent B) or relying solely on model capabilities (Agent C). This minimizes processing of empty space and maximizes text legibility."
