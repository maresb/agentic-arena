  "rationale": "Agent A remains the most complete and actionable plan with window-aware cropping, structured outputs, and downscaling verification. Remaining disagreements are substantive but limited: baseline quantization choice (Q4/Q5 vs Q8) and the level of pipeline complexity/benchmark detail. These are not just formatting differences, so convergence stays below 8."
