  "rationale": "Perfect convergence. The arrival of the new `Qwen3-VL` and `GLM-OCR` recommendations fundamentally changes the model choice, but the core architecture (Window-Aware Cropping + Delta Storage) remains valid. Agent A correctly pivoted the entire stack: replacing Qwen2.5-VL-72B with Qwen3-VL-32B (GUI-specialized, newer), adding GLM-OCR (faithful text extraction), upgrading quantization to Q8_0 (32B fits easily), and updating technical details like 32-multiple tile dimensions and dual-model NixOS config."
