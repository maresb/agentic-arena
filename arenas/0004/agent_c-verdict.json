  "rationale": "Perfect convergence on the new 2026 stack (Qwen3-VL-32B + GLM-OCR). Agent A is the clear winner because they not only pivoted correctly but also handled the critical implementation details: updating tile dimensions to be multiples of 32 (required for Qwen3), configuring NixOS for dual-model loading, and providing robust pseudocode for the parallel inference pipeline."
