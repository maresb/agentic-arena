  "rationale": "Perfect convergence. Agent A's solution is the gold standard. It correctly integrated the final optimization (Selective OCR) and provides a flawless implementation guide with robust pseudocode and correct NixOS configuration. Agent B contributed the valuable selective OCR idea but failed to update their config to support dual models. Agent C is aligned but less detailed."
