  "rationale": "Complete convergence across all three agents on every substantive decision: model (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct), quantization (Q4_K_M), strategy (window-aware cropping), output (structured JSON with semantic regions), fallback (landscape grid tiling), verification (Step 0 sanity check), optimization (delta storage with pHash), anti-hallucination (temperature=0, [illegible], structured prompts), and storage (SQLite/FTS, text-only). All agents report zero disagreements. The only differences are documentation style: Agent A has pseudocode and NixOS config, Agent B has the most balanced prose, Agent C is the most concise. Agent C uniquely adds maximized-window sub-tiling as an edge case. All three solutions are equivalent and any could be implemented interchangeably."
