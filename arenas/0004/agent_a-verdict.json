  "rationale": "All three agents agree on model selection (Qwen3-VL-32B + GLM-OCR), window-aware cropping, selective OCR, 32-aligned tiling, delta storage, and structured JSON. Agent C is the best non-self solution: concise, fully correct (NixOS config, Q8_0, selective OCR), zero errors. Agent B has the most thorough risk/question coverage but retains a config error (OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS='1') and omits explicit quantization guidance — both are easily fixable."
