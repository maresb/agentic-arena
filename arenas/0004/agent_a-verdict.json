  "rationale": "Complete convergence across all three agents. Every substantive decision is unanimous: model (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct), quantization (Q4_K_M), primary strategy (window-aware cropping), maximized window handling (sub-tile into 2 halves), output (structured JSON with semantic regions, no pixel bboxes), fallback (landscape grid tiling), verification (Step 0 sanity check), storage (delta hashing, SQLite/FTS, text-only), anti-hallucination (temperature=0, [illegible], structured prompts), and JSON reliability (format hints, repair, retries). All agents report zero disagreements. Agent B now includes NixOS config (adopted from Agent A) and maintains the cleanest prose. Agent C is the most concise and originated the maximized-window sub-tiling edge case. Both are excellent and interchangeable with Agent A's solution."
