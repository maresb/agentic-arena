  "rationale": "Complete convergence across all three agents. Every architectural decision is unanimous: Qwen3-VL-32B + GLM-OCR, Q8_0 quantization, selective OCR on text-heavy windows, window-aware cropping, 32-aligned tiling (1920x1088), delta storage (pHash), structured JSON, OCR over-trust mitigation, OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=2, and conflict resolution (GLM-OCR for body text, Qwen3-VL for UI labels). Agent B's config error from round 05 is now fixed. The only remaining differences are documentation depth (Agent A has pseudocode, Agent B has the most comprehensive risk list, Agent C is the most concise) — these are style/completeness choices, not architectural divergences. Both Agent C and Agent B are excellent: Agent C for its clean conciseness and correct OCR-over-trust handling, Agent B for its comprehensive risk coverage and pixel budget guidance."
