      "description": "Agent B suggests running GLM-OCR only on text-heavy windows (terminals, editors, browsers) to save latency. Agents A and C run GLM-OCR on every window crop. Agent B's selective approach is a pragmatic optimization worth adopting but has not been incorporated into A or C yet."

  "rationale": "All three agents fully converged on Qwen3-VL-32B + GLM-OCR, Q8_0 quantization, window-aware cropping, 32-aligned tiling, delta storage, and structured JSON. Agent C is the best non-self solution: concise, correct NixOS config, clean schema, and zero errors. Agent B has a valuable optimization (selective OCR) but contains a config error. The two divergences are minor: one is a typo fix and the other is a latency optimization, neither affecting architectural correctness."
