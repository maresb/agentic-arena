  "rationale": "All agents have fully converged on the Qwen2.5-VL-72B model, the window-aware cropping preparation strategy, and the Q4_K_M quantization level. Agent A provided the most rigorous technical justification regarding VRAM/KV cache limits and successfully synthesized the best efficiency optimizations (delta storage, native checks) into a coherent pipeline. Agent B is virtually identical but lacks the specific VRAM breakdown that clinched the quantization decision."
