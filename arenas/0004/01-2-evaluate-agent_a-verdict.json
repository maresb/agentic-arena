  "rationale": "All three agents have fully converged on every substantive decision: model (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct), quantization (Q4_K_M), primary strategy (window-aware cropping), output format (structured JSON with semantic regions, not pixel bboxes), fallback (grid tiling with landscape tiles), verification (Step 0 sanity check), and key risks (Ollama downscaling, hallucination, VRAM). Agent C conceded Q8_0 and adopted window-aware cropping; Agent B switched from square to landscape tiles and dropped pixel-precise bboxes. There are zero remaining architectural or correctness disagreements. The only differences are style and documentation depth: Agent A is the most verbose with pseudocode, Agent C is the most concise, and Agent B strikes the best balance of completeness, practicality, and clarity. Agent B's revised solution is the strongest non-self solution because it covers all key decisions with actionable detail, correctly applies landscape tiling math for the fallback, sources window bboxes from GNOME metadata (not the model), and maintains a clean structure without unnecessary verbosity."
