  "rationale": "Agent A provides the most complete, actionable pipeline (layout scan, window crops, synthesis) and flags runtime risks. However, there is still substantive disagreement on whether 4K can be processed without chunking (Agent C) and on unverified benchmark/model specifics (Agent A). These are non-trivial correctness and architecture concerns, so convergence is limited."
