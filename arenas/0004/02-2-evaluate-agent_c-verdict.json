All three agents have independently verified and adopted the same complex pipeline architecture (Qwen2.5-VL-72B Q4_K_M, window-aware cropping, delta hashing, structured JSON). Agent A's solution is the most complete implementation guide, including valuable NixOS configuration snippets and comprehensive pseudocode that integrates all optimizations (Z-order skipping, pyvips). It is the definitive reference implementation for this task."
