  "rationale": "Agent A offers the most complete and actionable pipeline with window-aware cropping, structured outputs, and explicit downscaling verification. Remaining differences are substantive but limited: default quantization choice (Q4/Q5 vs Q8) and the level of pipeline complexity/benchmark detail. These are not just formatting differences, so convergence is capped below 8."
