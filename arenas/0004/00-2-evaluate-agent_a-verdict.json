  "rationale": "All three agents unanimously selected Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct and agree on multi-pass processing with high-res crops. Agent B is the strongest non-self solution due to its practical tiling math, structured JSON output schema, delta storage optimization, and secondary OCR cross-checking — all of which are directly implementable and improve the downstream classification pipeline. Agent C has a cleaner narrative but contains two factual errors (Q8_0 VRAM fit for full 4K, and 'chunking is obsolete' given default max_pixels constraints) that could lead the user to repeat the downscaling hallucination problem they already experienced. The 3 remaining disagreements are: (1) whether chunking is needed at default settings (Agent C says no, Agents A and B say yes — this is empirically testable but the safe default is yes), (2) optimal tile shape (Agent B uses square 1344x1344, Agent A uses landscape 1920x1080 or window-aware — landscape/window-aware is more efficient for 16:9 desktops), and (3) whether VLMs can produce reliable pixel-level bboxes for structured deduplication (Agent B assumes yes, Agent A is skeptical). These disagreements are substantive but resolvable through empirical testing on the user's actual setup."
