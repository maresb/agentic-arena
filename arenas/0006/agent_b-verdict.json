The threshold was intentionally raised to 9 in commit 8b3932f alongside bidirectional divergence enforcement. Agent A's code change must be reverted."

  ],
  "rationale": "Agent C has the most structured, comprehensive, and factually accurate report. Its P1/P2/P3 prioritization is well-organized and it identifies more legitimate issues (coverage reporting, community files, link verification) than Agent B. Agent C also avoids Agent A's critical error of regressing the consensus threshold. Agent B (my own) is more precise on the threshold mismatch and provides exact diffs, but Agent C's broader coverage and cleaner structure makes it the stronger overall deliverable."
